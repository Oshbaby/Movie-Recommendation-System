# Movie Recommendation System

![Movie Recommender](https://img.shields.io/badge/Streamlit-Web%20App-brightgreen) ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8%2B-blue) ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Open%20Source-success)

Welcome to the **Movie Recommendation System** repository! This project is a web-based movie recommendation system built using **Streamlit** and powered by **Python**. It suggests movies based on user preferences by analyzing movie data and using cosine similarity to find similar movies. The system also fetches movie posters using **The Movie Database (TMDb) API** to provide a visually appealing experience.

---

## Features

- **Movie Selection**: Users can select a movie from a dropdown list.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: The system recommends 5 movies similar to the selected movie.
- **Movie Posters**: Displays movie posters for recommended movies using TMDb API.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a clean and intuitive UI.

---

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The dataset (`tmdb_5000_movies.csv`) is preprocessed to extract relevant features such as movie titles, genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
   - Text data (e.g., genres, keywords) is cleaned, stemmed, and converted into a format suitable for vectorization.
   - A **CountVectorizer** is used to convert text data into numerical vectors.
   - **Cosine Similarity** is calculated to measure the similarity between movies.

2. **Recommendation Algorithm**:
   - When a user selects a movie, the system identifies the most similar movies based on cosine similarity scores.
   - The top 5 similar movies are recommended to the user.

3. **Poster Fetching**:
   - The system uses the **TMDb API** to fetch movie posters for the recommended movies.

4. **Streamlit Web App**:
   - The web app is built using **Streamlit**, providing an interactive interface for users to select movies and view recommendations.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
